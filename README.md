# Karl-Grebe-Demo-Projects
This repo was set up to share some of my frontend demo projects and code.
I am a Systems Analyst and Automation Technologist, upgrading to a CS degree. I have learned html, CSS, and Javascript basics. I am now gaining experience with Github, while learning PHP, SQL and other web development basics.
Please feel free to browse through my repo and leave comments. I am happy to receive any constructive critism or advice from developers with more experience. Thank you.
This is a very interesting website.
